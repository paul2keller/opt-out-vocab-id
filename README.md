#  Proposal for an Opt-Out Vocabulary

This is the internet draft version of the  Proposal for an Opt-Out Vocabulary contained in the Annex to the Open Future Polcy Brief #8 ([A Vocabulary or Opting Out of AI Training and Other Forms of TDM](https://openfuture.eu/publication/a-vocabulary-for-opting-out-of-ai-training-and-other-forms-of-tdm/))

The document proposes a standardized vocabulary of use cases that can be targeted when expressing machine-readable opt-outs related to Text and Data Mining (TDM) and AI training. The vocabulary is agnostic to specific opt-out mechanisms and enables declaring parties to communicate restrictions or permissions regarding the use of their digital assets in a structured and interoperable manner. It defines three key use cases—TDM, AI Training, and Generative AI Training—which can be referenced by opt-out systems to ensure consistent interpretation across different implementations.
